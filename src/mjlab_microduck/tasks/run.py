"""Run task variant — push the velocity task toward an ALTERNATING running gait.

``make_run_variant(cfg)`` turns any microduck velocity-family env cfg into its
running counterpart, in the same shape as ``tasks/backlash.py``. Kept as a
transform rather than a new env cfg so it composes: the sprung phase becomes
``make_sprung_variant(make_run_variant(cfg))`` instead of a fourth copy of the
velocity env — the duplication that stranded the previous campaign.

Seven changes:

1. Activate the posture running regime. ``variable_posture`` gates on
   ``|lin| + |ang|`` with ``running_threshold`` defaulting to 1.5, which the
   stock command ranges only reach with both maxed — so the regime is dead code
   today, and ``std_running`` is aliased to ``std_walking`` anyway.
2. Swap ``air_time`` to ``feet_air_time_capped`` and shorten its window. The
   stock reward pays double for simultaneous two-foot flight, which rewards the
   bouncing gait; the stock window (0.10-0.25 s) was tuned to slow the gait.
3. Add ``alternating_flight``, which rewards flight only when the feet are
   genuinely alternating.
4. Add ``action_magnitude_monitor`` (zero contribution, non-zero weight).
5. Add ``forward_speed_monitor`` (zero contribution, non-zero weight) — the
   spec's success criterion is a *measured forward-speed plateau*, and the
   pre-existing ``error_vel_xy`` is isotropic so it cannot isolate forward
   tracking.
6. Retarget the speed curriculum: ramp forward speed only. ``forward_only=True``
   makes ``lin_vel_x`` grow as ``(0, range)`` instead of ``(-range, range)``,
   and ``update_lin_vel_y=False`` leaves the lateral range pinned at the
   velocity env's base value. ``ang_vel_range`` is held constant across stages,
   so forward speed is the single moving variable and the plateau measurement is
   a forward-speed number rather than an isotropic xy error.
7. Add a zero-contribution physical motor-envelope monitor for rated joint
   speed, torque, mechanical power, and an I-squared thermal-load proxy.
